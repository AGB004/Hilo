# Cards
Ready to guess some Cards? Here are the rules. Guess if the next card will be higher or lower. 100 points if you guess correctly, and lose 75 points if you guess incorrectly. As long as you don't hit 0 points, you can play again. If not, the game is over.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and 
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 cards 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the cards folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
